## Hey! :smile:

Thank you so much for take your time to contribute here!
We're so active and contributes are welcome!

## Make a pull request 👨🏽‍💻

We gladly accept pull request for new rules, projects, features, bug fixes, minor corrections, etc.

## Developing 🔨

In order to develop, you have two options:

<ol>
  <li>Improve Projects</li>
  <li>Create new Projects</li>
</ol>

## Important 🛑

[You must create and activate a Python3 virtual environment.](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

and then, you can continue with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run code style checks:

`flake8`

### Improve Projects ⚒️

You can improve the other projects, you just need to read carefully the `Readme.md` of the project.

### Create new Projects ⛏️

We accept all type or projects, the only rule scripts written in Python, so feel free to create and pull your python projects.

Take in consideration the next points:

<ol>
    <li>Create new folder for your project (lowercases and without whitespaces, you could use <code>-</code> or <code>_</code>)</li>
    <li>Add <code>README.md</code> in your project</li>
    <li>Add <code>requirements.txt</code> in your project with the only necessary packages</li>
</ol>
